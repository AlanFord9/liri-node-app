# liri-node-app

This application can be used to search songs on spotify, search concerts for musical artists, and get information on movies. 

## There are 4 commands this application can run through the terminal:
* concert-this: pull up info on a band and their upcoming shows
* spotify-this-song: pull information related to any song on spotify
  * if no song is entered, Spotify will search "ace of bass" by default
* movie-this: pull information on any movie
  * if no movie is entered, OMBD will search "mr. nobody" by default
* do-what-it-says: search the command in the txt file
